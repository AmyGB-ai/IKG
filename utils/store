Here is the analysis of the impact of the changed code:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The change from `string = response.read().decode('utf-8')` to `string = response.read()` may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded.",
    "The downstream file imports the `returnEmbed` function, which may be affected by the changed decoding of the response.",

  ]
}
```

In this analysis, I noted that the change from decoding the response to not decoding it may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the downstream file that imports the `returnEmbed` function. I rated the criticality of this change as 3, as it may not be immediately critical, but it could lead to issues if not properly handled. The recommendations are to verify the decoding, test the `returnEmbed` function, and consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

1.	Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to provide an automated invoice processing system “IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)” to ensure smooth, quick and efﬁcient services to REQUORDIT by AmyGB.ai. As compared to other mechanism of invoice processing, IDP will ensure that the requests, which falls under the scope can be addressed within the agreed and definite TAT committed to the customer. This will help the REQUORDIT team to reduce the TAT for document processing and have a higher productivity in their day to day operations.
 
 
 
 
 
2.	Purpose of the Document
The purpose of the document is to list down and document each and every necessary steps like Current Flow, Proposed Flow, Scope of the Project, Technical Infra Details and Report Mechanism.
This Document is prepared on the basis of the discussions carried out by various discussions between REQUORDIT and AmyGB Team.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.    Requirement Scope
An application to be developed by AmyGB to Automate the invoices wherein After the invoice is uploaded via API, Application will carry out the OCR, extract the defined key values and get the review done by the indexers and post review, make the file available to download in the PDF/tiff format.
 
 
An avg. of 8000 documents will get processed/day except month end wherein this may reach up to 20000 (last couple of days of the month). Each doc will contain an average of 5 pages. 80% of the docs for the day are uploaded between 6AM -8AM CDT which to be processed by noon and output will be downloaded by 6 PM CDT. Processing shall happen on AWS - on cloud. Extracted data is deleted (OCR- text + image) post 23 Hrs(From the time file is downloaded) and retain the meta data (which include the kvp, line items, doc class etc.)

6.     File merging and Re-ordering
7. 	File lock and release 
8.  	Real time generation of reports
 
 
   	Phase 1 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Classification/Re-Classification & Extraction Review-
A document should go through the OCR, and get classified as per the standard Invoice Or Supporting Document. Post Classification, if we realize there was error in classification, it should have option to re-classify and submit classification. Once classification is done, 16 defined key values with mandatory and optional fields to be extracted and reviewed by the indexers.
 
l  Supervisor QC model-
Also review can be done by the supervisor and admin as part of Supervisor QC review process wherein set % of the particular customer id based on the team it belongs to, files will flow to mapped supervisor for the QC
 
l  User & Team Management-
This will have 3 roles namely as 1) Indexer 2) Supervisor 3) Admin
Sup and Admin role will be allowed the addition, update and mapping of the users to customer IDs and supervisors
 
l  PDF & TIFF Download options-
Once the review is completed and submitted from both indexers and supervisors (in 100% QC model), file should be available to be downloaded as PDF/Tiff for the end customer
 
 
l  Rotation of a file-
If a document is skewed as an input, while performing the classification, it should rotate the image to 90 Degree or more and same should get downloaded as an output post completion of the Classification and Extraction
 
l  File merging and Re-ordering-
If an invoice is available in file1 out of multiple files in the same batch and Supporting Document of the respective invoice is available in file2, we should have option to merge the SD from File2 with Invoice in file1 and vice versa. This should have option of re-ordering of the page count with respect to the changes
 
l  File lock and release-
This feature will function as, once a file is opened by any indexer, it will be locked for 30 minutes and no one else can work on that file. Also, if an indexer opens multiple tabs or try to work on multiple files together, it will release the older files and allow to work on the latest file only to avoid the ambiguity 
 
l  Real time generation of reports of various doc lifecycle-
There should be an option available which can be used to generate    the reports on the real time for the document processing stats from Admin panel
 
 
Note- After the Go Live, the timeline for the Phase 1 hyper-care stage is 75 days where the AmyGB team will analyze the accuracy on the area of opportunities and fix the bugs comes on the way
 
 
II.      Phase 2 Scope:
Features to be considered for Phase 2 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.  	Table extraction spread across multiple pages within same/different files
2.  	Draw table bounds if table missed or incomplete table identified
3.  	Addition of rows at end of the table (new rows or missing row)
4.  	Merge/split/editing of rows of the table
5.  	QC of the extracted tabular data/line items with option to pick values via snippet
   	Phase 2 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Table extraction spread across multiple pages within same/different files-
This feature should allow the data to be extracted from the tabular invoices across multiple pages within same/different files
 
l  Draw table bounds if table is missed or incomplete -
Draw table bounds if table is missed or incomplete table identification for reprocessing via OCR
 
l  Addition of rows-
This feature will allow to add of rows at end of the table (new rows or missing row)
 
l  Merge/split/editing of rows of the table-
This feature should allow to merge/split/Edit the table rows where it is needed
 
l  QC of the extracted tabular data/line items -
This feature should allow to do the QC of the extracted tabular data/line items with option to pick values via snippet
 
 
Note- After the Go Live, the timeline for the Phase 2 to start is after 75 days, the requirements for the Phase 2 will commence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.   Phase 3 Scope:
Features to be considered for Phase 3 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.     Feedback Module
 
 
   	Phase 3 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Feedback Module-
This feature should allow the application to accept the feedback bases the inputs from the users. This will allow Key - Value Feedback - Instead of manual corrections on all key value extraction give feedback on selected failed files. The USP of this feature is that it also retrains the doc extraction module so that similar errors are not repeated in future batches
 
 
5.	Reports and Accuracy Logics
This section will give a clarity on the Mechanism of Reports for Uploaded and Processed Data.
 
After we go live with the solution in place, we shall generate the reports for document life cycle which should have visibility on page level details of the Invoices and supporting documents for billing purpose.
 
l  Monthly Billing Reports: Monthly billing reports will be created for billing purpose. This report will contain all the invoices along with page detail processed by the IDP for a specific month. This report will be used by AmyGB for all the invoicing purpose
 
 
6.	Billing Logic
The billing will be based on the total number of pages of the Invoices processed by the application. Commercials are closed over other email thread.
 
 
 
 
 
7.	Technical Infrastructure Requirement Details. [PROD & UAT]
This section will list down all the technical level infrastructural details for Production Server that will be necessary for this project. The scope of the project will require technical infrastructure at the REQUORDIT UAT server and also at the Production server.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure for UAT/Staging Server for UAT Testing:
After the training of the Application, the codes will be deployed on the UAT server of the REQUORDIT. It is important for the UAT server infrastructure to be similar to PROD server, as all the initial level testing will get carried out on the UAT server. UAT server should also have the similar API’s as the PROD server for the AmyGB to carry out the UAT level testing for the same.
 
Note- Any changes, bug fix or new requirements to be tested on Staging first before deploying it to Prod to have the no impact on the Prod environment

Here is the analysis of the impact of the changed code:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The change from `string = response.read().decode('utf-8')` to `string = response.read()` may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded.",
    "The downstream file imports the `returnEmbed` function, which may be affected by the changed decoding of the response.",
    "The `createJsonFeats.returnEmbed` function may receive incorrectly decoded data, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the response from the request is properly decoded and encoded in the correct format.",
    "Test the `returnEmbed` function with the changed decoding to ensure it behaves as expected.",
    "Consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues."
  ]
}
```

In this analysis, I noted that the change from decoding the response to not decoding it may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the downstream file that imports the `returnEmbed` function. I rated the criticality of this change as 3, as it may not be immediately critical, but it could lead to issues if not properly handled. The recommendations are to verify the decoding, test the `returnEmbed` function, and consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

2) few files in review completed
3) few files in all 3 headers
and so on On clicking Hard Reset, all files of the batch123 (under any tab) will all move to Rev pending and come to original state. The Batch123 filter will reflect and the user will be able to see that Batch/file in Rev Pending.
eg if Sup QC>Class Rev screen>Hard reset... the batch will move to Indexer Rev Pending in My Docs Screen and the user will be auto navigated there.

Here is the analysis of the impact of the changed code:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The change from `string = response.read().decode('utf-8')` to `string = response.read()` may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded.",
    "The downstream file imports the `returnEmbed` function, which may be affected by the changed decoding of the response.",
    "The `createJsonFeats.returnEmbed` function may receive incorrectly decoded data, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the response from the request is properly decoded and encoded in the correct format.",
    "Test the `returnEmbed` function with the changed decoding to ensure it behaves as expected.",
    "Consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues."
  ]
}
```

In this analysis, I noted that the change from decoding the response to not decoding it may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the downstream file that imports the `returnEmbed` function. I rated the criticality of this change as 3, as it may not be immediately critical, but it could lead to issues if not properly handled. The recommendations are to verify the decoding, test the `returnEmbed` function, and consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

    "The `createJsonFeats.returnEmbed` function may receive incorrectly decoded data, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the response from the request is properly decoded and encoded in the correct format.",
    "Test the `returnEmbed` function with the changed decoding to ensure it behaves as expected.",
    "Consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues."
  ]
}
```

In this analysis, I noted that the change from decoding the response to not decoding it may cause issues if the response is not properly decoded. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the downstream file that imports the `returnEmbed` function. I rated the criticality of this change as 3, as it may not be immediately critical, but it could lead to issues if not properly handled. The recommendations are to verify the decoding, test the `returnEmbed` function, and consider adding error handling to handle potential decoding issues.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

Here is the analysis of the changes and their impact on the downstream file:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string.",
    "The response from the request may contain non-ASCII characters, which could lead to encoding errors if not handled properly."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly.",
    "Consider adding error handling to deal with potential encoding issues.",
    "Test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding."
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string. The downstream file uses the `returnEmbed` method, which returns a JSON object. If the JSON object contains non-ASCII characters, the changes may cause encoding errors.

The criticality of this change is rated as 3, as it may cause issues if not handled properly, but it is not critical enough to warrant immediate attention.

The recommendations are to verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly, add error handling to deal with potential encoding issues, and test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases.

1.	Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to provide an automated invoice processing system “IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)” to ensure smooth, quick and efﬁcient services to REQUORDIT by AmyGB.ai. As compared to other mechanism of invoice processing, IDP will ensure that the requests, which falls under the scope can be addressed within the agreed and definite TAT committed to the customer. This will help the REQUORDIT team to reduce the TAT for document processing and have a higher productivity in their day to day operations.
 
 
 
 
 
2.	Purpose of the Document
The purpose of the document is to list down and document each and every necessary steps like Current Flow, Proposed Flow, Scope of the Project, Technical Infra Details and Report Mechanism.
This Document is prepared on the basis of the discussions carried out by various discussions between REQUORDIT and AmyGB Team.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.    Requirement Scope
An application to be developed by AmyGB to Automate the invoices wherein After the invoice is uploaded via API, Application will carry out the OCR, extract the defined key values and get the review done by the indexers and post review, make the file available to download in the PDF/tiff format.
 
 
An avg. of 8000 documents will get processed/day except month end wherein this may reach up to 20000 (last couple of days of the month). Each doc will contain an average of 5 pages. 80% of the docs for the day are uploaded between 6AM -8AM CDT which to be processed by noon and output will be downloaded by 6 PM CDT. Processing shall happen on AWS - on cloud. Extracted data is deleted (OCR- text + image) post 23 Hrs(From the time file is downloaded) and retain the meta data (which include the kvp, line items, doc class etc.)
 
 
 
 
Below are the discussed scoped items to be delivered in the phase wise manner-
 
1.	Classification/Re-Classification
2.	Extraction & Review
3.	Supervisor QC model
4.	User & Team Management
5.	PDF & TIFF Download options
6.	Rotation of a file
7.	File merging and Re-ordering
8.     File lock and release 
9.	Tabular Content Extraction + Draw Table Bounds only for tabular failures
10.  Tabular OCR Review with merging/splitting of rows on UI
11.  Real time generation of reports of various doc lifecycle
12.  Feedback Module
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following is the High Level process flow-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.	Scope of Work
The Scope of work for the project will be divided into three parts:
I.          Phase 1 Scope
II.        Phase 2 Scope
III.  	Phase 3 Scope
 
 
 
 
 
I.         Phase 1 Scope:
   Features to be considered for Phase 1 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.     Classification & Extraction Review
2.     Supervisor QC model
3.     User & Team Management
4.     PDF & TIFF Download options
5.     Rotation of a file
6.     File merging and Re-ordering
7. 	File lock and release 
8.  	Real time generation of reports
 
 
   	Phase 1 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Classification/Re-Classification & Extraction Review-
A document should go through the OCR, and get classified as per the standard Invoice Or Supporting Document. Post Classification, if we realize there was error in classification, it should have option to re-classify and submit classification. Once classification is done, 16 defined key values with mandatory and optional fields to be extracted and reviewed by the indexers.
 
l  Supervisor QC model-
Also review can be done by the supervisor and admin as part of Supervisor QC review process wherein set % of the particular customer id based on the team it belongs to, files will flow to mapped supervisor for the QC
 
l  User & Team Management-
This will have 3 roles namely as 1) Indexer 2) Supervisor 3) Admin
Sup and Admin role will be allowed the addition, update and mapping of the users to customer IDs and supervisors
 
l  PDF & TIFF Download options-
Once the review is completed and submitted from both indexers and supervisors (in 100% QC model), file should be available to be downloaded as PDF/Tiff for the end customer
 
 
l  Rotation of a file-
If a document is skewed as an input, while performing the classification, it should rotate the image to 90 Degree or more and same should get downloaded as an output post completion of the Classification and Extraction
 
l  File merging and Re-ordering-
If an invoice is available in file1 out of multiple files in the same batch and Supporting Document of the respective invoice is available in file2, we should have option to merge the SD from File2 with Invoice in file1 and vice versa. This should have option of re-ordering of the page count with respect to the changes
 
l  File lock and release-
This feature will function as, once a file is opened by any indexer, it will be locked for 30 minutes and no one else can work on that file. Also, if an indexer opens multiple tabs or try to work on multiple files together, it will release the older files and allow to work on the latest file only to avoid the ambiguity 
 
l  Real time generation of reports of various doc lifecycle-
There should be an option available which can be used to generate    the reports on the real time for the document processing stats from Admin panel
 
 
Note- After the Go Live, the timeline for the Phase 1 hyper-care stage is 75 days where the AmyGB team will analyze the accuracy on the area of opportunities and fix the bugs comes on the way
 
 
II.      Phase 2 Scope:
Features to be considered for Phase 2 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.  	Table extraction spread across multiple pages within same/different files
2.  	Draw table bounds if table missed or incomplete table identified
3.  	Addition of rows at end of the table (new rows or missing row)
4.  	Merge/split/editing of rows of the table
5.  	QC of the extracted tabular data/line items with option to pick values via snippet
   	Phase 2 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Table extraction spread across multiple pages within same/different files-
This feature should allow the data to be extracted from the tabular invoices across multiple pages within same/different files
 
l  Draw table bounds if table is missed or incomplete -
Draw table bounds if table is missed or incomplete table identification for reprocessing via OCR
 
l  Addition of rows-
This feature will allow to add of rows at end of the table (new rows or missing row)
 
l  Merge/split/editing of rows of the table-
This feature should allow to merge/split/Edit the table rows where it is needed
 
l  QC of the extracted tabular data/line items -
This feature should allow to do the QC of the extracted tabular data/line items with option to pick values via snippet
 
 
Note- After the Go Live, the timeline for the Phase 2 to start is after 75 days, the requirements for the Phase 2 will commence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.   Phase 3 Scope:
Features to be considered for Phase 3 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.     Feedback Module
 
 
   	Phase 3 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Feedback Module-
This feature should allow the application to accept the feedback bases the inputs from the users. This will allow Key - Value Feedback - Instead of manual corrections on all key value extraction give feedback on selected failed files. The USP of this feature is that it also retrains the doc extraction module so that similar errors are not repeated in future batches
 
 
5.	Reports and Accuracy Logics
This section will give a clarity on the Mechanism of Reports for Uploaded and Processed Data.
 
After we go live with the solution in place, we shall generate the reports for document life cycle which should have visibility on page level details of the Invoices and supporting documents for billing purpose.
 
l  Monthly Billing Reports: Monthly billing reports will be created for billing purpose. This report will contain all the invoices along with page detail processed by the IDP for a specific month. This report will be used by AmyGB for all the invoicing purpose
 
 
6.	Billing Logic
The billing will be based on the total number of pages of the Invoices processed by the application. Commercials are closed over other email thread.
 
 
 
 
 
7.	Technical Infrastructure Requirement Details. [PROD & UAT]
This section will list down all the technical level infrastructural details for Production Server that will be necessary for this project. The scope of the project will require technical infrastructure at the REQUORDIT UAT server and also at the Production server.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure for UAT/Staging Server for UAT Testing:
After the training of the Application, the codes will be deployed on the UAT server of the REQUORDIT. It is important for the UAT server infrastructure to be similar to PROD server, as all the initial level testing will get carried out on the UAT server. UAT server should also have the similar API’s as the PROD server for the AmyGB to carry out the UAT level testing for the same.
 
Note- Any changes, bug fix or new requirements to be tested on Staging first before deploying it to Prod to have the no impact on the Prod environment

Here is the analysis of the changes and their impact on the downstream file:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string.",
    "The response from the request may contain non-ASCII characters, which could lead to encoding errors if not handled properly."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly.",
    "Consider adding error handling to deal with potential encoding issues.",
    "Test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding."
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string. The downstream file uses the `returnEmbed` method, which returns a JSON object. If the JSON object contains non-ASCII characters, the changes may cause encoding errors.

The criticality of this change is rated as 3, as it may cause issues if not handled properly, but it is not critical enough to warrant immediate attention.

The recommendations are to verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly, add error handling to deal with potential encoding issues, and test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

Sanity testing usecase_Prod	10	
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	11	
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	12	
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	13		Rotation has to be done manually, auto rotation from AI will not happen.
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	14		Rotated file will have extraction and snippet support on Extraction Screen.
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	15		In case if failure or Extraction & snippet support, user will have to fill the extraction data himself but the output will be as per point 2. (Controlled testing with Abhijeet)
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	16		Draging, Movement of Pg's, Files, reordering on Classification Review Screen
Sanity testing usecase_Prod	17		Hard reset: Will come from Extraction Screen>Class Review Screen and will reset the changes made to the original AI classifcation (file uploded).
1) all files in extraction
2) few files in review completed
3) few files in all 3 headers
and so on On clicking Hard Reset, all files of the batch123 (under any tab) will all move to Rev pending and come to original state. The Batch123 filter will reflect and the user will be able to see that Batch/file in Rev Pending.
eg if Sup QC>Class Rev screen>Hard reset... the batch will move to Indexer Rev Pending in My Docs Screen and the user will be auto navigated there.
eg: if admin del the file/doc from UI.. Hard reset will get the same back from Rev Class screen and files will move to Rev Pending

Here is the analysis of the changes and their impact on the downstream file:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string.",
    "The response from the request may contain non-ASCII characters, which could lead to encoding errors if not handled properly."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly.",
    "Consider adding error handling to deal with potential encoding issues.",
    "Test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding."
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string. The downstream file uses the `returnEmbed` method, which returns a JSON object. If the JSON object contains non-ASCII characters, the changes may cause encoding errors.

The criticality of this change is rated as 3, as it may cause issues if not handled properly, but it is not critical enough to warrant immediate attention.

The recommendations are to verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly, add error handling to deal with potential encoding issues, and test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

Here is the analysis of the changes and their impact on the downstream file:

```
{
  "Issues": [
    "The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string.",
    "The response from the request may contain non-ASCII characters, which could lead to encoding errors if not handled properly."
  ],
  "Criticality": 3,
  "Recommendations": [
    "Verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly.",
    "Consider adding error handling to deal with potential encoding issues.",
    "Test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding."
  ]
}
```

Explanation:

The changed line removes the decoding of the response from UTF-8, which may cause issues if the downstream code expects a Unicode string. The downstream file uses the `returnEmbed` method, which returns a JSON object. If the JSON object contains non-ASCII characters, the changes may cause encoding errors.

The criticality of this change is rated as 3, as it may cause issues if not handled properly, but it is not critical enough to warrant immediate attention.

The recommendations are to verify that the downstream code can handle the change in encoding and adjust accordingly, add error handling to deal with potential encoding issues, and test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the changed encoding.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

Here is the analysis of the impact of the changed code:

```
{
    "Issues": [
        "The decode('utf-8') method has been removed, which may cause issues with character encoding in the response string.",
        "This might lead to errors or unexpected behavior when processing non-ASCII characters in the response."
    ],
    "Criticality": 3,
    "Recommendations": [
        "Verify that the response from the API is indeed in ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, and adjust the decoding accordingly.",
        "Consider adding error handling to handle potential encoding issues.",
        "Test the changed code with various input scenarios, including non-ASCII characters, to ensure correctness."
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* The changed line `string = response.read()` no longer decodes the response string using `decode('utf-8')`. This might cause issues with character encoding, especially if the response contains non-ASCII characters.
* The criticality of this change is moderate (3), as it may not cause immediate errors, but could lead to unexpected behavior or errors down the line.
* The recommendations include verifying the encoding of the response, adding error handling, and testing the changed code thoroughly to ensure correctness.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

1.	Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to provide an automated invoice processing system “IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)” to ensure smooth, quick and efﬁcient services to REQUORDIT by AmyGB.ai. As compared to other mechanism of invoice processing, IDP will ensure that the requests, which falls under the scope can be addressed within the agreed and definite TAT committed to the customer. This will help the REQUORDIT team to reduce the TAT for document processing and have a higher productivity in their day to day operations.
 
 
 
 
 
2.	Purpose of the Document
The purpose of the document is to list down and document each and every necessary steps like Current Flow, Proposed Flow, Scope of the Project, Technical Infra Details and Report Mechanism.
This Document is prepared on the basis of the discussions carried out by various discussions between REQUORDIT and AmyGB Team.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.    Requirement Scope
An application to be developed by AmyGB to Automate the invoices wherein After the invoice is uploaded via API, Application will carry out the OCR, extract the defined key values and get the review done by the indexers and post review, make the file available to download in the PDF/tiff format.
 
 
An avg. of 8000 documents will get processed/day except month end wherein this may reach up to 20000 (last couple of days of the month). Each doc will contain an average of 5 pages. 80% of the docs for the day are uploaded between 6AM -8AM CDT which to be processed by noon and output will be downloaded by 6 PM CDT. Processing shall happen on AWS - on cloud. Extracted data is deleted (OCR- text + image) post 23 Hrs(From the time file is downloaded) and retain the meta data (which include the kvp, line items, doc class etc.)
 
 
 
 
Below are the discussed scoped items to be delivered in the phase wise manner-
 
1.	Classification/Re-Classification
2.	Extraction & Review
3.	Supervisor QC model
4.	User & Team Management
5.	PDF & TIFF Download options
6.	Rotation of a file
7.	File merging and Re-ordering
8.     File lock and release 
9.	Tabular Content Extraction + Draw Table Bounds only for tabular failures
10.  Tabular OCR Review with merging/splitting of rows on UI
11.  Real time generation of reports of various doc lifecycle
12.  Feedback Module
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following is the High Level process flow-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.	Scope of Work
The Scope of work for the project will be divided into three parts:
I.          Phase 1 Scope
II.        Phase 2 Scope
III.  	Phase 3 Scope
 
 
 
 
 
I.         Phase 1 Scope:
   Features to be considered for Phase 1 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.     Classification & Extraction Review
2.     Supervisor QC model
3.     User & Team Management
4.     PDF & TIFF Download options
5.     Rotation of a file
6.     File merging and Re-ordering
7. 	File lock and release 
8.  	Real time generation of reports
 
 
   	Phase 1 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Classification/Re-Classification & Extraction Review-
A document should go through the OCR, and get classified as per the standard Invoice Or Supporting Document. Post Classification, if we realize there was error in classification, it should have option to re-classify and submit classification. Once classification is done, 16 defined key values with mandatory and optional fields to be extracted and reviewed by the indexers.
 
l  Supervisor QC model-
Also review can be done by the supervisor and admin as part of Supervisor QC review process wherein set % of the particular customer id based on the team it belongs to, files will flow to mapped supervisor for the QC
 
l  User & Team Management-
This will have 3 roles namely as 1) Indexer 2) Supervisor 3) Admin
Sup and Admin role will be allowed the addition, update and mapping of the users to customer IDs and supervisors
 
l  PDF & TIFF Download options-
Once the review is completed and submitted from both indexers and supervisors (in 100% QC model), file should be available to be downloaded as PDF/Tiff for the end customer
 
 
l  Rotation of a file-
If a document is skewed as an input, while performing the classification, it should rotate the image to 90 Degree or more and same should get downloaded as an output post completion of the Classification and Extraction
 
l  File merging and Re-ordering-
If an invoice is available in file1 out of multiple files in the same batch and Supporting Document of the respective invoice is available in file2, we should have option to merge the SD from File2 with Invoice in file1 and vice versa. This should have option of re-ordering of the page count with respect to the changes
 
l  File lock and release-
This feature will function as, once a file is opened by any indexer, it will be locked for 30 minutes and no one else can work on that file. Also, if an indexer opens multiple tabs or try to work on multiple files together, it will release the older files and allow to work on the latest file only to avoid the ambiguity 
 
l  Real time generation of reports of various doc lifecycle-
There should be an option available which can be used to generate    the reports on the real time for the document processing stats from Admin panel
 
 
Note- After the Go Live, the timeline for the Phase 1 hyper-care stage is 75 days where the AmyGB team will analyze the accuracy on the area of opportunities and fix the bugs comes on the way
 
 
II.      Phase 2 Scope:
Features to be considered for Phase 2 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.  	Table extraction spread across multiple pages within same/different files
2.  	Draw table bounds if table missed or incomplete table identified
3.  	Addition of rows at end of the table (new rows or missing row)
4.  	Merge/split/editing of rows of the table
5.  	QC of the extracted tabular data/line items with option to pick values via snippet
   	Phase 2 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Table extraction spread across multiple pages within same/different files-
This feature should allow the data to be extracted from the tabular invoices across multiple pages within same/different files
 
l  Draw table bounds if table is missed or incomplete -
Draw table bounds if table is missed or incomplete table identification for reprocessing via OCR
 
l  Addition of rows-
This feature will allow to add of rows at end of the table (new rows or missing row)
 
l  Merge/split/editing of rows of the table-
This feature should allow to merge/split/Edit the table rows where it is needed
 
l  QC of the extracted tabular data/line items -
This feature should allow to do the QC of the extracted tabular data/line items with option to pick values via snippet
 
 
Note- After the Go Live, the timeline for the Phase 2 to start is after 75 days, the requirements for the Phase 2 will commence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.   Phase 3 Scope:
Features to be considered for Phase 3 are as follows based on the discussions with the REQUORDIT team.
 
1.     Feedback Module
 
 
   	Phase 3 will consist scenarios related to the above categories described as below
l  Feedback Module-
This feature should allow the application to accept the feedback bases the inputs from the users. This will allow Key - Value Feedback - Instead of manual corrections on all key value extraction give feedback on selected failed files. The USP of this feature is that it also retrains the doc extraction module so that similar errors are not repeated in future batches
 
 
5.	Reports and Accuracy Logics
This section will give a clarity on the Mechanism of Reports for Uploaded and Processed Data.
 
After we go live with the solution in place, we shall generate the reports for document life cycle which should have visibility on page level details of the Invoices and supporting documents for billing purpose.
 
l  Monthly Billing Reports: Monthly billing reports will be created for billing purpose. This report will contain all the invoices along with page detail processed by the IDP for a specific month. This report will be used by AmyGB for all the invoicing purpose
 
 
6.	Billing Logic
The billing will be based on the total number of pages of the Invoices processed by the application. Commercials are closed over other email thread.
 
 
 
 
 
7.	Technical Infrastructure Requirement Details. [PROD & UAT]
This section will list down all the technical level infrastructural details for Production Server that will be necessary for this project. The scope of the project will require technical infrastructure at the REQUORDIT UAT server and also at the Production server.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure for UAT/Staging Server for UAT Testing:
After the training of the Application, the codes will be deployed on the UAT server of the REQUORDIT. It is important for the UAT server infrastructure to be similar to PROD server, as all the initial level testing will get carried out on the UAT server. UAT server should also have the similar API’s as the PROD server for the AmyGB to carry out the UAT level testing for the same.
 
Note- Any changes, bug fix or new requirements to be tested on Staging first before deploying it to Prod to have the no impact on the Prod environment

Here is the analysis of the impact of the changed code:

```
{
    "Issues": [
        "The decode('utf-8') method has been removed, which may cause issues with character encoding in the response string.",
        "This might lead to errors or unexpected behavior when processing non-ASCII characters in the response."
    ],
    "Criticality": 3,
    "Recommendations": [
        "Verify that the response from the API is indeed in ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, and adjust the decoding accordingly.",
        "Consider adding error handling to handle potential encoding issues.",
        "Test the changed code with various input scenarios, including non-ASCII characters, to ensure correctness."
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* The changed line `string = response.read()` no longer decodes the response string using `decode('utf-8')`. This might cause issues with character encoding, especially if the response contains non-ASCII characters.
* The criticality of this change is moderate (3), as it may not cause immediate errors, but could lead to unexpected behavior or errors down the line.
* The recommendations include verifying the encoding of the response, adding error handling, and testing the changed code thoroughly to ensure correctness.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.

Here is the analysis of the impact of the changed code:

```
{
    "Issues": [
        "The decode('utf-8') method has been removed, which may cause issues with character encoding in the response string.",
        "This might lead to errors or unexpected behavior when processing non-ASCII characters in the response."
    ],
    "Criticality": 3,
    "Recommendations": [
        "Verify that the response from the API is indeed in ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, and adjust the decoding accordingly.",
        "Consider adding error handling to handle potential encoding issues.",
        "Test the changed code with various input scenarios, including non-ASCII characters, to ensure correctness."
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

* The changed line `string = response.read()` no longer decodes the response string using `decode('utf-8')`. This might cause issues with character encoding, especially if the response contains non-ASCII characters.
* The criticality of this change is moderate (3), as it may not cause immediate errors, but could lead to unexpected behavior or errors down the line.
* The recommendations include verifying the encoding of the response, adding error handling, and testing the changed code thoroughly to ensure correctness.
The above is the summary of a code change and given below are some test cases. You will have to analyze the summary of the code changes and figure out if any of the test cases below require review OR will be impacted by the code changes.
